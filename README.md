Iris Dataset Analysis
This project uses the Iris dataset to demonstrate basic data analysis and visualization in Python. It starts by loading and exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and cleaning the data if necessary. Basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation are calculated, and the data is grouped by species to find average measurements.

The project also includes several visualizations to better understand the dataset. These include a line chart showing trends, a bar chart comparing average petal lengths across species, a histogram showing the distribution of sepal widths, and a scatter plot showing the relationship between sepal length and petal length. All plots are customized with titles, axis labels, and legends for clarity.

This work demonstrates how to perform simple exploratory data analysis and create clear, informative visualizations using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
