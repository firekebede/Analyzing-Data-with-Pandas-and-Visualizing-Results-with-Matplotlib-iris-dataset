Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization
Overview
This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization in Python using the Iris dataset.
It covers:

Loading and exploring a dataset

Cleaning missing data

Computing basic statistics

Grouping and summarizing

Creating multiple visualizations (Line, Bar, Histogram, Scatter)

Features
Error Handling for dataset loading

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Polymorphic visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

Four custom plots with titles, labels, and legends

Requirements
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
How to Run
Save the Python script as iris_analysis.py.

Run it in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python iris_analysis.py
View the printed dataset info and the displayed plots.

Visualizations Generated
Line Chart – Sepal length trend over samples

Bar Chart – Average petal length per species

Histogram – Distribution of sepal width

Scatter Plot – Sepal length vs. petal length, colored by species
